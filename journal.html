      <h3>What challenged me this month</h3>
      <p class="journal-date">January 2025</p>
      <p>
        The biggest challenge was balancing multiple major assignments due in the same week. I had a biology lab report, an English essay, and a history presentation all due within five days. At first I felt overwhelmed, but I learned to break each task into smaller steps and use a calendar to block out focused work time. I also realized I do my best writing in the morning, so I started waking up 30 minutes earlier to tackle essays before school.

      <h3>A mistake that helped me improve</h3>
      <p class="journal-date">December 2024</p>
      <p>
        I got feedback on my Shakespeare essay that my thesis was too broad — I was trying to cover three ideas when I should have focused on one. At first I was frustrated, but when I revised with a narrower focus, my whole essay became clearer and more persuasive. Now I always ask myself: "Can I state my main point in one sentence?" before I start writing. That one mistake taught me more about thesis statements than any lecture.

      <h3>The most interesting thing I learned in chemistry</h3>
      <p class="journal-date">November 2024</p>
      <p>
        We learned about chemical bonds and why certain elements form the compounds they do. What stuck with me was how the same carbon atom can form diamonds (one of the hardest substances) or graphite (used in pencils) — it's all about the arrangement. That made me think about how structure and organization matter in everything, not just chemistry. My notes are more organized now because of that lesson.

      <h3>How I improved my writing</h3>
      <p class="journal-date">October 2024</p>
      <p>
        At the start of the year, I struggled with conclusions — I would just repeat my introduction. My teacher suggested I think of the conclusion as answering "So what?" Why does this matter? I started ending my essays by connecting my argument to a bigger idea or asking a question for the reader to consider. My last two essays got much better feedback on the conclusion section. Small change, big impact.
