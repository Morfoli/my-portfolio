      <h3>What challenged me this month</h3>
      <p class="journal-date">January 2026</p>
      <p>
        Due to my ADHD, i have a tendencey to not be able to sleep until very late; therefore I am almost always tired in the mornings, and it is a constant struggle to get out of bed and start my day. Academics wise, nothing is too difficult yet, but then again, it's barely the 2nd semester.

      <h3>A mistake that helped me improve</h3>
      <p class="journal-date">December 2024</p>
      <p>
        During science, i kept forgetting the equations to find time, distance, velocity final, etc; so I just started writing them down at the top of my papers and i hope to turn that into a habit.

      <h3>How I improved my writing</h3>
      <p class="journal-date">October 2024</p>
      <p>
        At the start of the year, I struggled with conclusions — I would just repeat my introduction. My teacher suggested I think of the conclusion as answering "So what?" Why does this matter? I started ending my essays by connecting my argument to a bigger idea or asking a question for the reader to consider. My last two essays got much better feedback on the conclusion section. Small change, big impact.
