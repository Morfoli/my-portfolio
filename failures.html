      <h3>I keep forgetting to turn in my P.E. Syllabus</h3>

      <p>
        I'm just very forgetfull.

        <h4>What I changed</h4>
        <p>Whenever I'm bored, I go through canvas to see what I'm missing and set reminders on my phone to do them one at a time..</p>

      <h3>I missed a deadline and it cost me</h3>
      <p class="journal-date">December 2025</p>
      <p>
        I turned in my English Creative Short Storyy 3 weeks late. The penalty was 10 points, and my teacher's feedback was that I had rushed the second half. I had underestimated how long the research would take and didn't build in buffer time.
      </p>
      <div class="failure-lesson">
        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>I now use a backwards calendar: I write the due date, then work backwards to set my own deadlines (research done by X, draft by Y, revision by Z). I aim to finish one day early so I have time for surprises. I haven't missed a deadline since.</p>

      <h3>My first presentation was a mess</h3>
      <p class="journal-date">September 2024</p>
      <p>
        I read directly from my slides, spoke too fast, and ran over time. I could tell the class had tuned out. I knew my material but I hadn't practiced presenting it — I thought knowing the content was enough.
      </p>
      <div class="failure-lesson">
        <h4>What I changed</h4>
        <p>Before my next presentation, I practiced out loud three times. I timed myself and cut content to fit. I put only key words on slides, not full sentences, so I had to explain in my own words. My documentary presentation went much better because I treated the script like a speech and rehearsed it.</p>
