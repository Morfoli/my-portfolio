# My Learning Portfolio

A personal portfolio and learning journal website that documents academic growth, projects, reflections, and lessons learned. Built to showcase progress, metacognition, and self-awareness — qualities teachers love to see.

## What's Included

- **Home (About Me)** — Bio, academic interests, mission statement, professional photo
- **Projects** — Academic work with "What I learned" and "If I could redo this, I would..." reflections
- **Learning Journal** — Weekly/monthly reflections on challenges, mistakes, and growth
- **Skills & Growth** — Interactive resume (hover skills for examples), before/after work, improvement chart
- **Failures & Lessons** — Honest reflections on setbacks and what they taught you
